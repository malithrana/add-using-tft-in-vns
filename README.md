# Anomalous Data Detection in Vehicular Networks Using Traffic Flow Theory

This repository contains the appendix of the paper "Anomalous Data Detection in Vehicular Networks Using Traffic Flow Theory". It contains the complete set of results generated with different percentages (i.e. 10%, 20% and 40%) of anomalous nodes for different traffic scenarios.
